# Screenshots
NOTE: Screenshots are not uploaded to GitHub at the moment (first line of .gitignore)

The best, preferred way to organize screenshots would be with this structure:

- screenshots/
| - ID XX
  | - main.jpg (or png) [Main screenshot of the screen time]
  | - app1.jpg (or png) [Screenshot of the most used app screen time]
  | - app2.jpg (or png) [Screenshot of the second most used app screen time]
